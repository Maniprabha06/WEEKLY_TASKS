2. File Processing: 
    - Write scripts in both Bash and Csh that loop through a directory of files and print their names.
        Bash :
            - nano listfiles_bash.sh

            Script:
            #!/bin/bash
            for file in *; do
                echo "File : $file"
            done

            - chmod +x listfiles_bash.sh
            - ./listfiles_bash.sh

        Csh :
            - nano listfiles_csh.csh

            Script:
            #!/bin/csh
            foreach file (*)
                echo "File : $file"
            end

            - chmod +x listfiles_csh.csh
            - ./listfiles_csh.csh

    - Compare the syntax and efficiency of both scripts.
        Bash:
            - for file in *; do ... done.
            - * - all non hidden files.
            - clean , modern.
            - more flexible
                - can filter the file type.
                - use find , stat, test commands
                - extend into more complex workflows

        Csh:
            - foreach file (*) ... end.
            - * - all non hidden files.
            - slightly more verbose.
            - less flexible
            - can't filter the file type.
            - can't use find, stat, test commands.

        Efficiency:
            - for simple listing - both are fast and similar
            - for scalability and script extensions, Bash is better choice


example for filters:
Bash:
1.find

#!/bin/bash

echo "Finding all .txt files in current directory and subdirectories:"
find . -type f -name "*.txt"

2.stat

#!/bin/bash

echo "Listing files with size and modification date and time :"
for file in *; do
    if [ -f "$file" ]; then
        size=$(stat -c%s "$file")
        mod_time=$(stat -c%y "$file")
        echo "$file - $size bytes - Modified on $mod_time"
    fi
done

3.test

#!/bin/bash

for file in *; do
    if [ -f "$file" ]; then
        echo "$file is a regular file"
    elif [ -d "$file" ]; then
        echo "$file is a directory"
    else
        echo "$file is something else"
    fi
done

Csh:

don't use stat and find
#!/bin/csh

foreach file (*.txt)
    echo "File: $file"
    ls -l $file
end
