Key-Differences:
1.Variable Handling:
Bash:
    - Assignment : variable=value (No spaces)
    - Access : $variable

    bash
    #!/bin/bash
    name="Prabha"
    echo "Heyyy, $name"

    - Simple and consistent.
    - No confusion with quoting and spacing.

Csh:
    - Assignment : set variable =  value
    - Access : $variable
    - If it is a single word no quotes needed ..if it is more than one it has to be quoted.

    Csh
    #!/bin/csh
    set name = Prabha
    echo "Heyyy, $name"

    - Must use space around =.
    - Strings with spaces must be quoted.
    - Might be confusing.
