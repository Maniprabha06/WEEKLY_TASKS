5. Interactive Shell Exploration: 
    Bash:
        - Bash is the default ubuntu shell
        - History - with numbers,timestamps(with config).

        echo "History and Interactive use in Bash"
        ls //list the files and directory
        pwd //path of working directory
        whoami //shows which user
        history // shows history
        !! //runs previous command
        !1 //runs first command in history
        !ls //shows last ls command
        !-1 //runs last command in history
        !n //runs nth command in history
        alias prabha='ls -l' //alias name
        prabha // list the files (runs ls -l command)
        unalias prabha

    Csh:
        - was historically used For interactive use of commands we can prefer Csh.
        - History - with numbers(simple).
        
        in termianl type csh first it will show like %
        csh
        echo "History and Interactive use in Csh"
        set history = 100
        ls //list the files and directory
        pwd //path of working directory
        whoami //shows which user
        history // shows history in a simple way
        !! //runs previous command
        !1 //runs first command in history
        !-1 //runs last command in history
        !n //runs nth command in history
        !ls //shows last ls command
        alias prabha 'ls -l' //alias name
        prabha // list the files (runs ls -l command)
        unalias prabha
        exit //moves to default shell bash

    - Discuss the differences in interactive usability.
        Bash:
            - alias name='command'
            - tab completion Works by default
            - Ctrl+R - command search
            - Beginner-friendly, modern
        Csh:
            - alias name 'command'
            - tab completion Not supported unless using tcsh
            - Ctrl+R - command search Not supported unless using tcsh
            - Basic, lacks convenience features


        Bash: Far superior for interactive use â€” better history, auto-completion, inline search, and consistent behavior.

        Csh: Good for minimal command-line use, but lacks features unless using tcsh.
