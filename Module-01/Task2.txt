2. Processor_speed:
    - The speed at which a processor can execute instructions.
    - processor(CPU) ->chef , instruction per second ->chef's cooking speed , dishes -> operations , recipe -> instructions
    - simple task -> less time, complex task -> more executing time
    - efficient code -> CPU Will Benefits

    HANDS-ON:
    - Write a C program that performs a large number of simple arithmetic operations (e.g., addition, multiplication) in a loop.
        step 1:
            # nano processor_speed.C //a terminal based editor will open
        step 2:
        PROGRAM:
            #include <stdio.h>
            int main(){
                long long int i,result=0;
                for(i=0;i<1000000;i++){
                    result+=i*3;
                }
                printf("result : %lld\n",result);
                return 0;
            }
        step 3:
        # gcc processor_speed.c -o processor_speed //executable file

    - Use the time command to measure the execution time of your program.
        # time ./processor_speed //shows output

    - Modify the program to perform more complex operations or increase the loop iterations.
        # nano processor_speed.C

    Modified PROGRAM:

        for(i=0;i<200000000;i++){
            result+=(i*2)/3 + (i%7);
        }

            # gcc processor_speed.c -o processor_speed
            # time ./processor_speed // shows output with more executing time

    - Measure the new execution time and discuss how the processor's speed affects the overall performance.
        - if I increase the complexity of the operation it results in longer execution time.
        - Optimizing the code can increase the performance of the CPU.
        - The Processor gets benefited from efficient code.


    - Extension: Research and explain CPU clock cycles, and how that relates to instructions per second.
        CLOCK CYCLES:
        - It is the smallest unit of time in the CPU.
        - It is like a heartbeat that tells the CPU when to do something.
        - CPU performs action sync with the Clock cycle.
        - It is measured in Hertz(Hz) or cycles per second.

        INSTRUCTIONS PER SECOND:
        - Instructions per second (IPS) indicate how many instructions a CPU can execute in one second.
        - A higher IPS means the CPU can process more commands in the same amount of time.

                                       Clock speed
        Instruction per second = -----------------------
                                 cycles per Instruction

        CPU runs at 2 GHz and each instruction it takes on average 2 cycles,then

                                    2,000,000,000
        Innstruction per second = ------------------ = 1,000,000,000
                                          2

        - It takes 1 billion Instruction per second.
